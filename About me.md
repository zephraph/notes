Hi, I'm Justin.

I’m a software engineer at [Oxide Computer Company](https://oxide.computer) working remotely from Brooklyn, NY. Previously at [Artsy](https://www.artsy.net), [Recurse](https://www.recurse.com/) ‘21 alumni, co-host of [devtools.fm](https://devtools.fm), and host of [hci.fm](https://hci.fm).

I'm currently on Sabbatical focusing on building better habits, forming new relationships, and researching the future of computing.
